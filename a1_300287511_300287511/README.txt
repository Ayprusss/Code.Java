this Assignment (being assignment 1) essentially wanted us to create a variety of methods that would be a part of various classes in order to properly build and manage a parking Lot. This parking lot was represented by a 2D-Array, 
and included a variety of methods such as Park (adds a variable of type Car into the array), CanParkHere(verifies if a car can park in a specific spot), etc. This zipped folder contains a directory containing the following files.

-Car.java
-ParkingLot.java
-Util.java
CarType.java
