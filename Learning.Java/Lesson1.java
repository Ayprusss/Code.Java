        // void is one of the returntypes that returns nothing.
        //Name() follows after to identify the purpose of the function i.e. SendEmail
        // in the () brackets, you identify the parameters of the function
        // in {} brackets; we put the code in. 
        //{ left brace is put on same line of function
        //Main() is the main line of the code of which gets executed. they execute functions all from a single class.
